														<h2>Masters and PhD Research Training</h2>
<p>Students with lived experience of health and/or social disadvantage can face multiple barriers to education - even after
completing high school or university education, they often cannot access any further opportunities. </br></br>
The purpose of the IEDI masters and PhD program is to place students with health and/or social disadvantage in teaching, research, and academic positions in the future. 
												</p>
													</header>

<p>
<h4>Eligibility

</h4>

This program is designed specifically for: <strong></br></br>
1. TRAINEES LIVING WITH DISABILITIES (AND THEIR CAREGIVERS)</br>
2. TRAINEES LIVING WITH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES (AND THEIR CAREGIVERS)</br>
3. TRAINEES REPRESENTING MANY INDIGENOUS NATIONALITIES AROUND THE WORLD</br>
4. TRAINEES WHO ARE DISPLACED, OR LIMITED TO RURAL AND/OR MARGINALIZED AREAS WITH UNEQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION</br>
5. SPECIAL TRAINEES WHO EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE CHALLENGES LISTED ABOVE.</strong>
</br></br>
Where possible, <strong>IEDI strongly encourages all students to apply to educational opportunities which are accredited in their home country</strong>. 
</br></br>
There currently exists a gap in higher-education for students with disabilities and other health/social disadvantages. The Masters and PhD program at IEDI seeks
to address this gap through building upon other open-access education initiatives around the world. Carefully read through 
this page prior to submitting an application. </br></br>

Our goal is to support students with disabilities/chronic illness/mental health challenges/or rural status in teaching and research positions - not exclusive to, but especially in fields of academic research relevant to their lived experience. We have a secondary mission of supporting caregivers of these students in teaching and research positions around the world. 
</br></br>
We believe lived experience of disabilities/chronic illness/mental health challenges/or rural status has value, and prepares students as excellent researchers and teachers for society. We also believe that it is society’s responsibility to acknowledge this lived experience, and not prevent disadvantaged students from career and financial security that could break familial poverty. 
</br></br>
<h4>The programs seek to fill the existing gap in higher education for disadvantaged students and their caregivers via:
</h4>
Providing a personal accessibility support staff to meet learning needs, bi-weekly to weekly, throughout each individual year of studies</br>
Full-tuition scholarships and fellowships via application</br>
Application fee waiver to all students</br>
Online Masters / Distance Masters, or Online PhD / Distance PhD options with technology-based accessibility support</br></br>

<h4>Application Requirements
</h4>
Masters applicants must hold a bachelors degree; PhD applicants must hold a masters degree. Bachelor thesis is not currently considered for admission to 
the PhD program, although students are encouraged to apply to the Masters program. </br></br>
If you need assistance completing up to a bachelors degree, contact admin@i-edi.org for support. 
Currently, there are already existing resources to complete university - up to a Masters degree - such as
<a href="https://nextgenu.org/" target="blank">NGU</a> as
founded by the Institute for Lifestyles Medicine at Harvard and other international governing organizations. 
</br></br>
If you choose to complete a Masters program (Master of Public Health) through education initiatives such as the above, but are required to pay
in order to receive accreditation or final diploma/certificate (ie. through EUCLID) , this payment is not necessary 
for IEDI to accept your education at another institution as valid. 

</br></br>
To apply to IEDI Masters or PhD programs, students should submit:
<li>Letter of Intent
<li>CV
<li>Diplomas from previous degrees (note: previous uncompleted degrees are considered by IEDI as positive bonuses that add to your application. See section below)
<li>Transcripts from previous degrees (scans or web screenshots accepted; official copies required upon acceptance)
<li>Research proposal
<li>Writing samples (previous thesis, reports, publications, proposals, working manuscript etc., up to 3)

</br></br>In addition to the six items above, students may choose to submit:
<li>Letter of Explanation for any previous experiences and unique situations, including uncompleted degrees
<li>Test scores such as GRE and English-language tests (scans accepted)
<li>Any certification, outputs, or products that demonstrate merit 
<li>References 
</br></br>
Students may submit up to 12 reference contacts. Please note:

<li>Reference contacts, email, or phone, are preferred. Letters will be assessed, but only as secondary supplements
<li>Reference contacts should be professional or academic; if using email, references should possess an institutional or organizational email address. The only situation in which free emails are accepted will be for retired professionals or professionals who have moved organizations


</br></br>
<strong>Notes</strong>
<li>There is no application fee for any student
<li>If you have questions about the program, you are encouraged to inquire with as many components of the application package listed above DIRECTLY in the first email, for us to better assess your situation
<li>Successful applicants will be invited to an interview. The interview should be considered a defense-style exam, and serves the purpose of verifying
all student-submitted information

</br></br>
<strong>Academic Calendar</strong></br>
Applications are open, and students may receive acceptance on a rolling basis within the larger structure of the following deadlines:
</br>
Annually: 
</br>
January 30th for Summer Semester</br>
May 30th for Fall Semester</br>
September 30th for Winter Semester</br>
</br>
<strong>Scholarships, Fellowships, Tuition & Fees</strong></br></br>
<li><strong>Basic fee structure</strong>: 4800 USD per semester: 9 semesters for doctoral studies, 6 semesters for masters-level studies - which may be covered completely by IEDI funding (below). There are no additional student activity fees, book fees, registration fees, convocation fees etc. IEDI follows fixed-tuition policy for the entire duration of the program. Future annual increases only impact new incoming cohorts. 

<li><strong>Full tuition scholarships & fellowships</strong>: depending on financial need, availability of other awards, and merit, all students receive scholarships and fellowships that meet the no-interest loan policy.

<li><strong>No-interest policy</strong>: IEDI believes that debt is 
a strong factor in keeping cycles of poverty for families experiencing health and/or social disadvantages. 
Students are encouraged to apply for governmental loans if these loans have an interest-free payment period. If students do not have opportunities to access interest-free loans, IEDI will support students in applying for external awards; in the meantime, IEDI will cover all remaining tuition with a combination of scholarships and fellowships.
<li><strong>External Scholarship Policy</strong>: students are encouraged to apply for external scholarships, grants, and awards before and during their studies. Internal scholarships and fellowships will be reduced according to the amount of successful external funding. In all cases, prior to application, students and supervisors will discuss additional top-up awards from IEDI.
<li><strong>Internal Scholarships vs Fellowships</strong>: scholarships are direct financial awards, whereas fellowships consist of training tasks that involve further work from the student, but may assist in building professional experience for future job positions.

<h3>Post-doctoral Opportunities</h3>
We strongly recommend PhD holders not to apply to IEDI for post-doctoral positions due to the following:
</br></br>
<li>Wages for post-doctoral scholars at IEDI are not offered, or, at best standardized at local rates for LLSKH, which rarely meeting livable wage standards in many areas around the world.
<li>As our mission is to place students with disabilities/chronic illness/mental health challenges and their caregivers in teaching and research positions, we strongly encourage students as such to apply to organizations where they may wish to work in the future as faculty.
</br></br>
If for any reason students choose to apply for post-doctoral positions at IEDI (such as preference for on-line based remote position or the preference for personal accessibility support; or it is a requirement for a faculty position), IEDI will:
</br></br>
<li>Support applicants in applying for external post-doctoral funding
<li>If applicants are successful in external post-doctoral funding which may be transferable, IEDI will also assist students in transferring such funding to other universities to undertake their post-doctoral work there
<li>Students are free to choose to undertake post-doctoral research at IEDI or other institutions at any given point in time
</br></br>
To apply, please follow all instructions for Masters/PhD.
